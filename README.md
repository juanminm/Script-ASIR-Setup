# Script generator for ASIR VM servers.

This script can generate multiple Bash script files which include all commands necessary to have a working server.

The script will start with a form where you will input information about your DMZ and LAN IP, hostnames and other service-related information (like domain name for LDAP and DNS services). After all the information has been filled up, it will generate the script with the input information.

**This is not to be used in a professional environment. Although there may be some configuration that can work for professional environments, there is no guarantee that there may be weaknesses.**

*This script has been made for use in a specific Spanish ASIR course environment with the objective of aiding other classmates that have been stuck on some configuration or to redo the server from scratch.*
